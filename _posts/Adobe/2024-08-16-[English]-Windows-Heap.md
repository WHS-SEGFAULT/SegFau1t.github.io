- There are two types of Windows heap allocation mechanisms:
    1. **NT Heap** : This is the traditional Windows heap allocation mechanism.
    2. **Segment Heap** : Introduced in Windows 10, this is a newer heap allocation mechanism. However, i[English] Windows Heap ac6965382984472ea71940afa5bc3f8dt has not been widely adopted, because many programs are optimized for the NT heap.

## 1. NT Heap and LFH

- To reduce heap fragmentation and improve performance, heap allocation and management are handled using both Back-End Heap and Front-End Heap mechanisms.

---

- **Back-End Heap :**
    - This process involves the Windows OS directly allocating memory for the heap.
    - Since it accesses memory directly, the processing speed tends to be slower.

---

- **Front-End (LFH, Low Fragmentation Heap) :**
    - LFH is the default Front-End heap manager in Windows OS since the introduction of Windows Vista.
    - It reduces heap fragmentation and improves performance.
    - **How LFH Works:**
        1. When heaps of the same size are allocated multiple times by the Back-End Heap, LFH pre-allocates multiple heaps of that size.
            1. It divides a contiguous heap region into equal-sized sections, preparing multiple heap chunks of the same size.
            2. The `UserBlock` structure manages these equally-sized heap chunks that were divided in the previous step.
        2. When a heap of the same size needs to be allocated again, LFH returns a heap from the chunks managed by the `UserBlock` structure.
            
            â‡’ This improves performance by avoiding the need to access the Back-End heap and reduces heap fragmentation as heaps of the same size are placed consecutively.
            

## 2. UserBlock

- The **UserBlock** structure consists of a UserBlock Header and multiple Heap Chunks.
- **UserBlock Header :**
    - The UserBlock Header contains the following values:
        - **Signature :** A constant that indicates the block is an LFH UserBlock, with the value `0xF0E0D0C0`.
        - **BusyBitmap.Data :** This points to the BitmapData of the UserBlock Header. It is used to access memory addresses within the UserBlock.
        - **BitmapData :** This records the information of the allocated Heap Chunks within the heap memory managed by the UserBlock.
- **Heap Chunks :**
    - Each Heap Chunk includes an 0x8-byte size **Heap Chunk Header**.
    - The Heap Chunk Header contains the **Chunk Number**.
        - The **Chunk Number** is indexed starting from 0 for the first Heap Chunk, which is closest to the UserBlock Header.
